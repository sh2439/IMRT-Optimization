# IMRT-Optimization

[Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy#Intensity-modulated_radiation_therapy_(IMRT)) (IMRT) is an effective approach in cancer treatment. The main idea is to utilize beamlets to irradiate patients to kill tumor cells, while protecting healthy organs as much as possible. The treatment plan can be formulated as an optimization problem. This repository holds the solution to this optimization problem.
